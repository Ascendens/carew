I'm very happy to release Carew v2.0.0.

### Some new features:

* Built-in pagination;
* Built-in code highlighting;
* Built-in table of content generator;
* Added a `published` flag to all documents;
* Added feed for tag page (eg: `blog.com/tags/tag-name/feed/atom.xml`);
* Added support for custom blog post url format.
* The boilerplate comes with bootstrap 3.3

### How to install it?

    $ php composer.phar create-project carew/boilerplate my_website
    $ cd my_website
    $ bin/carew build
    $ bin/carew serve

### How to update?

you just need to update your `composer.json` file:

    "require": {
        "carew/carew": "~2.0",
        "carew/theme-bootstrap": "~2.1"
    },

then you need to run `composer update`, and that's it.
